Storage exercise using generics and abstract class - quick and simple example 

The idea is that we can create the storage for a certain type of item, like clothing, 
naming an object ,for example, tshirt, give it a fuller name in a constructor, like 'Black Plain T-Shirt', 
give it a clothing type - 'Top' and its category like kids/adults. 

While creating a storage, we provide its max capacity - how many items it can store. 

Storage has some functions - we can add an item, delete an item, display all items, 
check capacity (get an integer) or get percentage capacity.

Every created storage gets an id. 

Static method howManyStorages tells how many storages have been created.
